This directory includes scripts relating to Seurat clustering and gene expression analysis of Tritrichomonas DropSeq data. Protists were isolated from infected mouse caeca 6 weeks post infection, purified by triple cell sorting, and prepared for single cell RNA-Seq at the Princess Margaret Genomics Centre.
Data were collected for protist isolated from a germ-free and conventionalized C57BL/6 mouse.  

Scripts are included for:
1. Raw data processing
2. Seurat cell clustering and marker gene identification
3. KEGG pathway enrichment (EC overrepresentation)
4. GO term enrichment
5. Gene set analysis
