This directory includes scripts relating to analysis of single cell gene expression patterns in Tritrichomonas. Data were generated using the Drop-Seq platform (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002) and analysed using the Seurat R-package (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.048). Protists were isolated from infected mouse caeca (one germ-free, one conventionalized C57BL/6) 6 weeks post infection and purified by triple cell sorting prior to library preparation. 

Scripts are included for:
1. Raw data processing
2. Seurat cell clustering and marker gene identification
3. KEGG pathway enrichment (EC overrepresentation)
4. GO term enrichment
5. Gene set analysis
